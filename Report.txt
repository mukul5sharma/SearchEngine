Implementation : 

Indexer.py
(This file is used to create a inverted index of documents)
- I first create a inverted list of documents mapping words 
  to documents with their term frequency for that word.For this
  I use a dictionary of dictionary to store the words and documents 
  along with their term frequencies. While entering this information 
  I skip the words that are entirely digits.

BM25.py
(this File performs the task of calculating bm25 scores for all the 
 Documents and writes those documents in a file)
- First I read the data from the indeer.out file and enter this 
  information again into a dictionary of a dictionary data structure
- Next step is to calculate the length of each documents and the cumulative 
  length of all documents.
- Then for every query, a BM25 score is calculated for each document relating 
  to that query and again stored in a dictionary.
- The documents are Sorted according to the score and returned as the output
